# Configuration

Siesta decouples request _configuration_ from request _initiation_. Any code can request a resource without knowing all the details of _how_ to request it, e.g.: “I want to display the user’s profile. Request it if necessary; you know what to do. Tell me whenever it changes.”

To accomplish this, Siesta lets you customize requests on a _per-resource_ basis, not just a _per-request_ basis. However, because of the ephemeral nature of `Resource` instances, it wouldn’t work to configure them by directly setting properties of `Resource`. Any such changes would vanish unpredictably during periods of low memory. (Note that everything in [the `Resource` class’s API](http://bustoutsolutions.github.io/siesta/api/Classes/Resource.html) is either (1) read-only or (2) related to requesting and updating content, not configuration.)

Instead, all of a resource’s customizable options are in the [`Configuration`](http://bustoutsolutions.github.io/siesta/api/Structs/Configuration.html) struct. This struct appears as a property of `Resource`, but it is a read-only property (and thus immutable — Swift’s most brilliant feature). To change configuration options, you provide closures to [`Service.configure(...)`](http://bustoutsolutions.github.io/siesta/api/Classes/Service.html#/Resource%20Configuration).

Your configuration closures receive a _mutable_ copy of the configuration, which they reference as `$0.config`. Each closure can apply globally across the service, to a single resource, or to a subset of resources. You can specify resource subsets with a wildcard pattern or a custom predicate. Closures can modify the mutable configuration before the resource receives it and it becomes immutable.

Configuration closures are run:

- every time a `Resource` needs to compute (or recompute) its configuration
- in the order they were registered (so put your global config before resource-specific overrides)
- if and only if they apply to the resource in question.

## Example! Please!

Yes, that was all a little heady. An example will help make it clear:

```swift
class MyAPI: Service {
  init() {
    super.init(base: "https://api.example.com")

    // Global config
    configure {
      $0.config.headers["User-Agent"] = "MyAwesomeApp 1.0"
      $0.config.headers["X-App-Secret"] = "2g3h4bkv234"
      $0.config.headers["Accept"] = "application/json"
    }

    configure("/**/knob") {
      // At this point, global config above has already run.
      // We change one header, but leave the others untouched.
      $0.config.headers["Accept"] = "doorknob/round, doorknob/handle, */*"
      $0.config.responseTransformers.add(MyCustomDoorknobParser())
    }

    configure("/volcanos/*/status") {
      $0.config.expirationTime = 0.5  // default is 30 seconds
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration mechanism is quite robust, particularly when combining [`Configuration.beforeStartingRequest(_:)`](https://bustoutsolutions.github.io/siesta/api/Structs/Configuration.html#/s:FV6Siesta13Configuration21beforeStartingRequestFRS0_FFTCS_8ResourcePS_7Request__T_T_) with request hooks. For example:

```swift
let authURL = authenticationResource.url

configure({ url in url != authURL }, description: "catch auth failures") {
  $0.config.beforeStartingRequest { _, req in  // For all resources except auth:
    req.failure { error in                     // If a request fails...
      if error.httpStatusCode == 401 {         // ...with a 401...
        showLoginScreen()                      // ...then prompt the user to log in
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See the documentation for [`Service.invalidateConfiguration()`](http://bustoutsolutions.github.io/siesta/api/Classes/Service.html#/s:FC6Siesta7Service23invalidateConfigurationFS0_FT_T_) for information about dynamic configuration, e.g. authentication tokens.
