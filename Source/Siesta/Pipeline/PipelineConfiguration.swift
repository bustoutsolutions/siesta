/**
  A sequence of transformation and cache operations that Siesta applies to server responses. A raw response comes in the
  pipeline, and the appropriate data structure for your app comes out the other end. Apps may optionally cache responses
  in one or more of their intermediate forms along the way.

  A pipeline has sequence of **stages**, each of which is uniquely identified by a `PipelineStageKey`. Apps can create
  custom stages, and customize their order. Each stage has zero or more `ResponseTransformer`s, followed by an optional
  `EntityCache`.

  The pipeline is a part of a `Configuration`, so you can thus customize the pipeline per API or per resource.

      service.configure {
        $0.pipeline[.parsing].add(SwiftyJSONTransformer, contentTypes: ["*​/json"])
        $0.pipeline[.cleanup].add(GithubErrorMessageExtractor())
        $0.pipeline[.model].cacheUsing(myRealmCache)
      }

      service.configureTransformer("/item/​*") {  // Replaces .model stage by default
        Item(json: $0.content)
      }

  By default, Siesta pipelines start with parsers for common data types (JSON, text, image) configured at the
  `PipelineStageKey.parsing` stage. You can remove these default transformers for individual configurations using calls
  such as `clear()` and `PipelineStage.removeAllTransformers()`, or you can disable these default parsers entirely by
  passing `standardTransformers: []` when creating a `Service`.

  Services do not have any persistent caching by default.
