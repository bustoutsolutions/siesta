/**
  A strategy for saving entities between runs of the app. Allows apps to:

  - launch with the UI in a valid and populated (though possibly stale) state,
  - recover from low memory situations with fewer reissued network requests, and
  - work offline.

  Siesta uses any HTTP request caching provided by the networking layer (e.g. `URLCache`). Why another type of
  caching, then? Because `URLCache` has a subtle but significant mismatch with the use cases above:

  * The purpose of HTTP caching is to _prevent_ network requests, but what we need is a way to show old data _while
    issuing new requests_. This is the real deal-killer.

  Additionally, but less crucially:

  * HTTP caching is [complex](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html), and was designed around a set of
    goals relating to static assets and shared proxy caches — goals that look very different from reinflating Siesta
    resources’ in-memory state. It’s difficult to guarantee that `URLCache` interacting with the HTTP spec will
    exhibit the behavior we want; the logic involved is far more tangled and brittle than implementing a separate cache.
  * Precisely because of the complexity of these rules, APIs frequently disable all caching via headers.
  * HTTP caching does not preserve Siesta’s timestamps, which thwarts the staleness logic.
  * HTTP caching stores raw responses; storing parsed responses offers the opportunity for faster app launch.

  Siesta currently does not include any implementations of `EntityCache`, but a future version will.

  - Warning: Siesta calls `EntityCache` methods on a GCD background queue, so your implementation **must be
             thread-safe**.

      This method is called for both cache writes _and_ for cache reads. The `resource` therefore may not have
      any content. Implementations will almost always examine `resource.url`. (Cache keys should be _at least_ as unique
      as URLs except in very unusual circumstances.) Implementations may also want to examine `resource.configuration`,
      for example to take authentication into account.

      - Note: This method is always called on the **main thread**. However, the key it returns will be passed repeatedly
              across threads. Siesta therefore strongly recommends making `Key` a value type, i.e. a struct.

      Cache implementations should treat the `forKey` parameter as an opaque value.)

      This method receives entities _after_ they have been through the transformer pipeline. The `entity.content` will
      be a parsed object, not raw data.

      Implementations are under no obligation to actually perform the write. This method can — and should — examine the
      type of the entity’s `content` and/or its header values, and ignore it if it is not encodable.

      Note that this method does not receive a URL as input; if you need to limit caching to specific resources, use
      Siesta’s configuration mechanism to control which resources are cacheable.
