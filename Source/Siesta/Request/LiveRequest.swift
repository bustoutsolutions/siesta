      Creates (but does **not** start) a new request using custom request logic.

      This method allows you to make a request using custom / external logic that does not use the service’s normal
      network provider. For example, you could use this to wrap a third-party OAUth library as a Siesta request, then
      use `Configuration.decorateRequests(...)` and `Request.chained(...)` to wait for OAuth before proceeding with the
      normal Siesta request.

/**
  Allows you to create `Request`s with custom logic. This is useful for taking things that are not standard network
  requests, and wrapping them so they look to Siesta as if they are. To create a custom request, pass your delegate to
  `Resource.prepareRequest(using:)`.

  You can also implement Siesta’s `Request` protocol yourself, but this is a daunting task full of pitfalls and
  redundant effort. This protocol provides customization points for only the things custom requests typically need to
  customize, and provides standard behavior and sanity checks. In particular, using `RequestDelegate`:

  - provides standard implementations for all the request hooks,
  - ensures those hooks are called _exactly_ once, even if your delegate misbehaves and reports multiple responses,
  - tracks request state and ensures valid state transitions,
  - polls request progress, and
  - handles cancellation cleanly, preventing “response after cancel” race conditions.

  Siesta itself uses this protocol to implement its own requests. Look at `NetworkRequestDelegate` and
  `RequestChainDelgate` in Siesta’s source code for examples of implementing this protocol.
