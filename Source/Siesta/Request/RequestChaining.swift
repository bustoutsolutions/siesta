extension Request
    {
    /**
      Gathers multiple requests into a **request chain**, a wrapper that appears from the outside to be a single
      request. You can use this to add behavior to a request in a way that is transparent to outside observers. For
      example, you can transparently renew expired tokens.

      - Note: This returns a new `Request`, and does not alter the original one (thus `chained` and not `chain`). Any
          hooks attached to the original request will still see that request complete, and will not see any of the
          chaining behavior.

      In this pseudocode:

          let chainedRequest = underlyingRequest.chained {
            response in …whenCompleted…
          }

      …the following things happen, in this order:

      - The chain waits for `underlyingRequest` to complete.
      - The response (no matter whether success or failure) gets passed to `whenCompleted`.
      - The `whenCompleted` closure examines that `response`, and returns a `RequestChainAction`.
        - If it returns `.useResponse` or `.useThisResponse`, the chain is now done, and any hooks attached to
          `chainedRequest` see that response.
        - If it returns `.passTo(newRequest)`, then the chain will wait for `newRequest` (which may itself be a chain),
          and yield whatever repsonse it produces.

      Calling `cancel()` on `chainedRequest` cancels the currently executing request and immediately stops the chain,
      never executing your `whenCompleted` closure. (Note, however, that calling `cancel()` on `underlyingRequest`
      does _not_ stop the chain; instead, the cancellation error is passed to your `whenCompleted` just like any other error.)

      - Warning:
          This cancellation behavior means that your `whenCompleted` closure may never execute.
          If you want guaranteed execution of cleanup code, attach a handler to the chained request:

              let foo = ThingThatNeedsCleanup()
              request
                .chained { …some logic… }           // May not be called if chain is cancelled
                .onCompletion{ _ in foo.cleanUp() } // Guaranteed to be called exactly once

      Chained requests currently do not support progress. If you are reading these words and want that feature, please
      file an issue on Github!
