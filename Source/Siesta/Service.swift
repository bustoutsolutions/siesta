/**
  A set of logically connected RESTful resources. Resources within a service share caching, configuration, and a
  “same URL → same resource” uniqueness guarantee.

  You will typically create a separate instance of `Service` for each REST API you use. You can either subclass
  `Service` or encapsulte it inside a wrapper. Regardless, to reap the benefits of Siesta, you’ll want to ensure that
  all the observers of an API share a single instance.

  You can optionally specify a `baseURL`, which allows you to get endpoints by path: `service.resource("/foo")`.
  Specifying a `baseURL` does _not_ limit the service only to subpaths of that URL. Its one and only purpose is to be
  the starting point for `resource(_:)`.

  Note that `baseURL` is only a convenience, and is optional.
  If you want to group multiple base URLs in a single `Service` instance, use `resource(baseURL:path:)`.
  If you want to feed your service arbitrary URLs with no common root, use `resource(absoluteURL:)`.

          The URL underneath which the API exposes its endpoints. If nil, there is no base URL, and thus you must use
          only `resource(absoluteURL:)` and `resource(baseURL:path:)` to acquire resources.
      - Parameter standardTransformers:
          By default, includes:
             - JSON → `Dictionary`/`Array`
             - text → `String`
             - image → `UIImage`/`NSImage`.

          The handler to use for networking. The default is `URLSession` with ephemeral session configuration. You can
          pass a `URLSession`, `URLSessionConfiguration`, or `Alamofire.Manager` to use an existing provider with
          custom configuration. You can also use your own networking library of choice by implementing `NetworkingProvider`.

      Configuration closures apply to any resource they match, in the order they were added, whether global or not. That

      of this method that takes a predicate as its first argument.

          Selects the subset of resources to which this configuration applies. You can pass a `String`, `Resource`, or
          `NSRegularExpression` for the `pattern` argument — or write your own custom implementation of
          `ConfigurationPatternConvertible`.
      - Parameter requestMethods:
          If specified, only applies this configuration to requests with the given HTTP methods.
          Defaults to *all* methods.
      - Parameter description:
          An optional description of this piece of configuration, for logging and debugging purposes.
      - Parameter configurer:
          A closure that receives a mutable `Configuration`, referenced as `$0`, which it may modify as it
          sees fit. This closure will be called whenever Siesta needs to generate or refresh configuration. You should
          not rely on it being called at any particular time, and should avoid making it cause side effects.

    /**
      Transforms responses by passing their content through the given closure. This is a shortcut for adding a
      `ResponseContentTransformer` to the `Configuration.pipeline`.

      Useful for transformers that create model objects. For example:

          configureTransformer("/foo/​*") {
            FooModel(json: $0.content)
          }

      By default, the transfromer applies to GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests — the HTTP methods that commonly
      return a description of the resulting resource in the response body. If your API does not return a full model for
      all these HTTP methods, you may need to configure different transformers for different request methods.

      For example, here is configuration for a hypothetical API that wraps responses to mutating requests in an envelope
      which the app models with an `UpdateResult` struct:

          configureTransformer("/foo/​*", requestMethods: [.get]) {
            FooModel(json: $0.content)
          }

          configureTransformer("/foo/​*", requestMethods: [.post, .put, .patch]) {
            UpdateResult<FooModel>(json: $0.content)
          }

      Note that `configureTransformer(...)` does _not_ apply to HEAD and OPTIONS by default, but `configure(...)` does.

      Siesta checks that the incoming `Entity.content` matches the type of the closure’s `content` parameter. In the
      example code above, if the `json` parameter of `FooModel.init` takes a `Dictionary`, but the transformer pipeline
      at that point has produced a `String`, then the transformer outputs a failure response.

      You can use this behavior to configure a service to refuse all server responses not of a specific type by passing
      a transformer that passes the content through unmodified, but requires a specific type:

          service.configureTransformer("**") {
            $0.content as JSONConvertible  // error if content from upstream in pipeline is not JSONConvertible
          }

      - SeeAlso: `configure(_:requestMethods:description:configurer:)`
          for more into about the parameters and configuration pattern matching.
      - SeeAlso: `ResponseContentTransformer`
          for more robust transformation options.

      Signals that all resources need to recompute their configuration next time they need it.

      Because the `configure(...)` methods accept an arbitrary closure, it is possible that the results of
      that closure could change over time. However, resources cache their configuration after it is computed. Therefore,
      if you do anything that would change the result of a configuration closure, you must call
      `invalidateConfiguration()` in order for the changes to take effect.

      _《insert your functional programming purist rant here if you so desire》_

      Note that you do _not_ need to call this method after calling any of the `configure(...)` methods.
      You only need to call it if one of the previously passed closures will now behave differently.

      For example, to make a header track the value of a modifiable property:

          var flavor: String? {
            didSet { invalidateConfiguration() }
          }

            }
          }

      Note that this method does _not_ immediately recompute all existing configurations. This is an inexpensive call.
      Configurations are computed lazily, and the (still relatively low) performance impact of recomputation is spread
      over subsequent resource interactions.
