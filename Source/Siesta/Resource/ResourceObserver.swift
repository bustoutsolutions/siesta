      - Warning: This method is **not** called for self-owned observers when the observer itself being deallocated is
          what caused it to stop observing. This is because there is no way for Siesta to know that observer is _about_
          to be deallocated; it can only check whether the observer is already gone.

          For example:

              var myObserver: MyObserver? = MyObserver()
              resource.addObserver(myObserver!)  // myObserver is self-owned, so...
              myObserver = nil                   // this deallocates it, but...
              // ...myObserver never receives stoppedObserving(resource:).

          In the situation above, `MyObserver` should implement any end-of-lifcycle cleanup using `deinit`.

      The typical use for this method is for glue objects whose only purpose is to act as an observer, and which would
      not normally be retained by anything else.

      - Note: By default, this method prevents duplicates **only if the observer is an object**. If you pass a struct

              in Swift. You can implement `ResourceObserver.observerIdentity` to make a struct prevent duplicates;

              of closure identity: there is no such thing as “the same” closure in the language, and thus no way to
              detect duplicates. It is thus the caller’s responsibility to prevent redundant calls to this method.
