    The changing state of the resource, corresponding to the resource's events.

    Note that content is typed; you'll get an error (in latestError) if your resource doesn't produce
    the type you specify.

    Subscribing to this publisher triggers a call to `loadIfNeeded()`, which is probably what you want.

    As with non-reactive Siesta, you'll immediately get an event (`observerAdded`) describing the current
    state of the resource.

    The publisher will never error out, or in fact complete at all. Please dispose of your subscriptions
    appropriately, otherwise you'll have a permanent reference to the resource.

    Events are published on the main thread.

    Note that as befits network operations, Siesta's Combine methods produce cold observables. What
    that means here is that network ops don't happen until subscription time. This is particularly
    important when dealing with `Request` (see request methods below). (If you don't know about hot
    and cold observables, stop putting it off and read
    https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/Documentation/HotAndColdObservables.md)
