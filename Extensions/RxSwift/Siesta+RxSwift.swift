    /**
    The changing state of the resource, corresponding to the resource's events.

    Note that content is typed; you'll get an error (in latestError) if your resource doesn't produce
    the type you imply.

    Subscribing to this sequence triggers a call to `loadIfNeeded()`, which is probably what you want.
    For example, it lets you do things like this, refreshing the resource whenever the view appears:

    ```
    func viewDidLoad() {
        ...
        rx.viewWillAppear  // theoretical reactive extension to UIViewController implemented using rx.methodInvoked
            .flatMapLatest {
                api.interestingThing.rx.state()
            }
            .subscribe { [weak self] (state: ResourceState&lt;InterestingThing&gt;) in
                ...
            }
            .disposed(by: disposeBag)
    }
    ```

    As with non-rx, you'll immediately get an event (`observerAdded`) describing the current state of the resource.

    The sequence will never error out, or in fact complete at all. Please dispose of your subscriptions
    appropriately, otherwise you'll have a permanent reference to the resource.

    Events are published on the main thread.

    Why doesn't this return `Driver`, especially since the request methods use traits rather than plain
    observables? Mainly because Driver is in RxCocoa, and I didn't want to import that here. (There's probably
    an argument to be made that Driver ought to be in RxSwift - although it's useful when writing UI code,
    it's not *only* useful for that.) With reference to driver's characteristics:
    - events are published on the main thread, like Driver
    - doesn't error out, like Driver
    - you get the resource state as soon as you subscribe (via the observerAdded event), so you effectively
      have replay(1) here too
